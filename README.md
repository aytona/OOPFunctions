Assignment 1: Utility Program

The goal of this assignment is to build an application that consists of several
utility functions that a user can select from a main menu. Once a function is
selected, the user will likely be prompted for further input until the function runs
and displays its results to the user. Include the following criteria:

Main Menu UI

Below is an example of the user-interface displayed to the user in the console
once the application is executed:

WELCOME!

Please select one of the following functions:

1) Kilograms to Pounds

2) Celcius to Kelvin

3) Teaspoons to Millilitres

4) Multiplication Table

5) Squares Table

X) Exit

Enter Option:

When the user enters 1-5, clear the screen and you will prompt the user with
further information (explained for each option in the next section) and display the
proper result. After outputting, be sure to give the user an option to return to the
main menu.

Criteria & Guidelines

The following section lists everything you need to add to your application.

1) For option 1, write a function where you are going to prompt the user
for a number of kilograms and convert that amount to pounds and display it to the user. 

2) For option 2, write a function where you are going to prompt the user
for a degrees in Celsius and convert that amount Kelvin and display it
to the user. 

3) For option 3, write a function where you are going to prompt the user
for an amount in Teaspoons and convert that amount millilitres and
display it to the user. 

4) For option 4, write a function that accepts an integer parameter n from
the user. This function should print out the multiplication table for all
values between 1 and n. Make sure you function works for at least n =
12. Your function should return if the paramter n is less than or equal
to 0. 

5) For option 5, write a function that accepts an integer parameter n. This
function should print out the a table that displays the square value for
each integer between 1 and n. Your function should return if the
parameter n is less than or equal to 0. 

6) Remember that once you print out the required output for each option
that you have an option to return to the main menu. There are no
classes yet required for this assignment BUT you DO need to
have all five menu items in their own functions.
